                <h2>Birth and Early Childhood</h2>
                <p>Albert Einstein was born on 14th March 1879, in Ulm in the kingdom of Wuttemberg in the German Empire.His parents were Herman Einstein , a salesman and engineer , and Pauline Koch. When he attained the age of 1 year, his family relocated to Munich , where his father and uncle founded an electrical equipment manufacturing company.</p>
                <p>As a child, Einstein showed early signs of curiosity and intelligence although he did not speak until he was 4 years old.His parents worried that he might have a learning disability. However he began to show to show a deep interest in Science and Mathematics at an early age, particularly when his father gave him a compass , sparking fascination with the unseen forces of nature. </p>

            <div id="education">
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>Einstein's formal education began at Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. He was not particularly happy with the strict and regimented environment of the German School system. However he excelled in Mathematics and Physics on his own, often studying advanced topics independently. He later attended Aargau Cantonal School in Switzerland where he completed his secondary education.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="adulthood">
                <h2>Early Adulthood</h2>
                <p>Einstein renounced his German citizenship in 1896 to avoid military service and enrolled at the Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. He gradated in 1900 with a degree in Physics and Mathematics. After graduating , he faced difficulty in finding a teaching job and ended up working at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern as a patent examiner.</p>
                <p>This job provied him with a steady income and ample time to develop his theories. During this period, he married Mileva Maric ,a fellow physicist. They had two sons :Hans Albert and Eduard. </p>

            <div id="contributions">
                <h2>Major Contributions and Inventions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Special Theory of Relativity(1905): 
                        <ul id="list"> <li>In his "Annus Mirabillis"(Miracle Year), he published four groundbreaking papers in the Annalean der Physik. One of these introduced the Special theory of relativity which revolutionized the understanding of space, time and energy. The famous equation  <em>E =mc <sup>2</sup></em> emerged from this theory establishing the equivalence of mass and energy.  </li> </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Photoelectic Effect(905):
                        <ul id="list"> <li>Another paper from his Miracle year explained the photoelectric effect , where light is quantized into photons. The work was pivotal in establishing quantum theory and earned him the Noble Prize in 1921.</li> </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Brownian Motion(1905) :
                        <ul id="list"> <li>Einstein's paper on Brownian Motion provided empirical evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules by explaining the random motion of particles suspended in fluid.</li></ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>General Theory of Relativity(1915):
                        <ul id="list"> <li>In 1915, Einstein presented the general theory of relativity extending his earlier theory to include gravity. This theory proposed that massive objects cause a distortion in spacetime, which is felt as gravity. The confirmation of the theory came in 1919 when observations of a solar eclipse confirmed the bending of light by the sun's gravity. </li></ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div id="later">
                <h2>Later Life and Legacy</h2>
                <p>Einstein continued to contribute to the theoretical physics throghout his lifetime ,including work on a unified field theory and quantum mechanics, although he had reservations about the later. He emigrated to the United States in 1933 to escape the rize of the Nazis in Germany and accepted a postion at the Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey </p>
                <p>During his later years ,he became an outspoken advocate for civil rights and humanitarian causes ,using his fame to promote peace and freedom. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>He passed away on April 18,1955, in Princeton , New Jersey. His contributions to science have left an inredible mark on or understanding of the universe and his name has become synonymous with genius.</p>
